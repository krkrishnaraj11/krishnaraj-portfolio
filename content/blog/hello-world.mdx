## The Beginning

After seven years of building production applications across banking, fintech, and consumer platforms, I've accumulated a wealth of knowledge that I believe is worth sharing. This blog is my way of giving back to the developer community that has helped me grow.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about topics close to my daily work — frontend architecture patterns, React and React Native best practices, state management at scale, and the lessons I've learned shipping 15+ production apps across 5 countries.

Expect deep dives into:

- **React ecosystem** — React, React Native, Next.js, and React Native Web
- **Architecture patterns** — Scalable frontend systems, SDK development, and micro-repo strategies
- **Banking & fintech** — KYC, MFA, secure onboarding, and regulatory compliance in digital platforms
- **Performance** — Rendering optimizations, caching strategies, and memory-efficient patterns

## Why Now?

Working on ADCB's Private Banking and Tesla AutoLoan platforms has given me a unique perspective on building enterprise-grade applications. I want to document these experiences while they're fresh and share the patterns that have proven effective at scale.

Whether you're a junior developer looking to level up or a senior engineer exploring new architectural approaches, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

Let's build something great together.
